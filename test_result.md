- Test all endpoints: user creation, bot matching, chat sessions, WebSocket connections
- Verify database operations and data persistence

### Frontend Testing  
- Manual testing recommended for UI/UX validation
- Test responsive design across different screen sizes
- Validate WebSocket connectivity and real-time messaging

### API Integration Testing
- Test with actual API keys when provided
- Validate fallback systems
- Performance testing under load

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (FastAPI)
- **7 Realistic Bot Profiles** with unique personalities
- **WebSocket Real-time Chat** with session management
- **MongoDB Integration** with proper data models
- **Moderation System** with violation tracking
- **API-Ready Structure** for external AI services

### Frontend (React)
- **Mobile-First Design** with Android app aesthetics
- **Real-time UI Updates** via WebSocket
